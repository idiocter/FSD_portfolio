HOW TO ADD YOUR PICTURE:
================================

1. Copy your profile picture to this folder (images/)
2. Rename it to: profile.jpg
3. Make sure it's a .jpg, .jpeg, or .png file
4. Recommended size: 300x300 pixels or larger
5. Square images work best for the circular display

If your image has a different name:
- Open index.html
- Find the two <img> tags (around lines 28 and 44)
- Change "images/profile.jpg" to "images/YOUR_IMAGE_NAME.jpg"

The picture will appear in:
- The home section (top of page)
- The about section (middle of page)
